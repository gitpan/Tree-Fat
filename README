Tree::Fat      RdcO  Embeddable F-Tree Algorithm Suite            JPRIT

Implements object-oriented trees using algorithms adapted from b-trees
and AVL trees (without resorting to yucky C++).  It's essentially a
cross between a tree and an array.


The reasons for another tree implementation are as follows:

- Publically available code is the best tested.  Bug ridden trees are
completely unacceptable.  This module has been put through test
coverage analysis and considerable stress testing.

- The algorithms have been completely separated from any notion of a
database.  The code is tweaked for easy embedding into other
applications.  A very flexible set of hooks are available while still
preserving the functional abstraction.

** 03-09-99 RELEASE 1.11

- Repaired for 5.005_56.  Malloc/free are now used consistently.


** 01-05-99 RELEASE 1.1

- Option to cache first and last key of each tree node.  Seek can use
these to avoid touching actual records (if they happen to be in slow
memory).

- Added comments to MANIFEST (before I forget everything! :).

- Some macros are renamed or simplified.

- Declare lots of variables 'register' just in case it matters.

- Ran with Insure++.  Didn't find much.
