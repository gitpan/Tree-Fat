Tree::Fat      adcO  Embeddable F-Tree Algorithm Suite            JPRIT

Implements object-oriented trees using algorithms adapted from b-trees
and AVL trees (without resorting to yucky C++).


The reasons for another tree implementation are as follows:

- Publically available code is the best tested.  Buggy trees are
completely unacceptable.  This module includes test coverage analysis.

- The algorithms have been completely separated from any notion of a
database; the code is tweaked for easy embedding into other
applications.
