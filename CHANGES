** 02-03-98 RELEASE 0.09

- Fixed a serious bug in seek (when unique=1).  Expanded regression
tests.

- Minor tweaks.


** 01-23-98 RELEASE 0.07

- Factored out code that isn't sensitive to key/data layout.
Unfortunately, this change necessitated tweaking the memory layout.

- tc_insert has much better overall performance.  tc_seek now does a
full binary search.  tc_delete is re-implemented with rotations.
Asymptotic performance is now respectable.

- tv_compress, tv_balance added.

- memmove & memcpy of slots used throughout (instead of assignment).
Added more hooks for C++.  Fixed cpp (re)directives.


** EARLIER RELEASES

- Purified.

- Compiles with C++.

- Attempted to optimize the fill ratio.  tc_insert version 0.01 only
used about 35% of the available slots!  After adding a bunch of
kludges, I got it up to 65%.  Hm.  Need to re-think this.

- Tightened constraints for cursor boundry conditions.
