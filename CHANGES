- Purified.

- Compiles with C++.

- Re-designed the tree node.

- Attempted to optimize the fill ratio.  tc_insert version 0.01 only
used about 35% of the available slots!  After adding a bunch of
kludges, I got it up to 65%.  Hm.  Need to re-think this.

- Tightened constraints for cursor boundry conditions.

- There seems little point in not caching the node treefill.  This
option is now manditory.  For the same reason, tc_where has been
retired.
