*** SCALING UP

tree compression
  fix delete with rotations
  if TnFILL < TnWIDTH / 3 then stepnode to look for a merger

tc_insert
  try harder to find easy places to do insertions
  bigger benchmarks

rotation
  investigate LL & RR splay style rotations

tc_seek
  OPTIMIZE!!  Can probably get keycmp number down 50-70%.

fake-up a tied array API
  push/unshift flags
  pop/shift flags

allow treefill/depth updates to be switched off temporarily
  reduce the need for write locks == parallel insert mode!

macros
  run through a profiler
  try memmove!
  replace TnCALCDEPTH with something faster?
  improve FREE macro?
  store the TcSTAT names somewhere so we can nuke the #defines

keep track nodes-per-subtree?

factor out key/data independent methods into a common library

split out ccovscan.pl
